# AI-Amplify_Twitter_Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis
## I have created this project in AI Amplify Hackathon which scraps the tweets and do sentiment analysis

## 1. What I did?
I developed a Twitter Tweets Sentiment Analysis project where I implemented a data scraping mechanism using Python, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium. The project enables the extraction of tweets in real-time based on specified handles or hashtags. Subsequently, sentiment analysis is performed on the collected tweets utilizing the BERT model for classification into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## 2. How I have Implemented?
The project involves two main components:
- Data Scraping: Utilizing Python, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium, I created a system capable of scraping tweets in real-time, allowing for the analysis of current tweets associated with specific handles or hashtags.
- Sentiment Analysis with BERT Model: Employing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I implemented a sentiment analysis algorithm based on the BERT model. This model classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of the sentiments expressed in the collected data.

## 3. What was the impact?
The project had the following impacts:

- Real-time Sentiment Analysis: The ability to scrape and analyze current tweets provides real-time insights into public sentiment, enabling timely reactions to emerging trends or issues.
- Visualization Capabilities: The sentiment analysis results can be visualized, offering a clear and intuitive representation of the sentiments associated with specific handles or hashtags.
- Enhanced Understanding of Social Media Sentiments: This project contributes to a deeper understanding of public sentiments on Twitter, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic planning based on the sentiments expressed in the analyzed tweets.
